# calendar_app
A calendar I created with the intention to store memories from the past, and soon add reminders for future dates... love you 
To run you must download files, and open a command prompt where these files are stored and run node server.js, this should open the server if done correctly, now just head to https://localhost:3000 to see the website in action!
